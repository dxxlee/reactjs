      <h1>1. What is a Framework?</h1>
      <p>
        A framework is a set of tools, libraries, and conventions that provide a structured way to develop applications. Frameworks offer pre-built components, standardized code patterns, and guidelines that simplify the development process, especially for complex applications. They save time by handling many routine tasks, allowing developers to focus on writing unique parts of their code.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Differences and Advantages of Frameworks</h2>
      <h3>Frontend vs. Backend:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js help create interactive, user-facing applications.</li>
        <li>Backend frameworks like Django, Express.js, and Ruby on Rails handle server-side logic, database interactions, and API creation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> Frameworks often come with reusable components, which can be customized and reused across an application.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Frameworks enforce a consistent code structure and development process, making it easier for teams to work together.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> With pre-built modules and libraries, frameworks speed up development by reducing the amount of code needed to start a project.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Popular frameworks have strong community support, extensive documentation, and frequent updates, which means issues are resolved quickly, and there are plenty of resources available for learning and troubleshooting.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. What Kind of Frameworks Would You Choose and Why?</h2>
      <p>For different types of projects, choosing the right framework is essential. Here are a few considerations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>React (Frontend):</strong> Great for building dynamic, interactive user interfaces. Itâ€™s fast, component-based, and widely used, making it a good choice for many frontend projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Express (Backend):</strong> Lightweight and fast for building APIs. It works well with Node.js and is ideal for creating scalable backend solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Django (Full-Stack):</strong> A powerful backend framework that includes a lot of built-in functionality, including user authentication, ORM, and templating, suitable for larger applications that require rapid development and scalability.</li>
      </ul>
